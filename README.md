# Graphical-UI
A library for controlling the LCD display of a ventilation system

This library was used in a project where an automated ventilation system was built up using LPC1549 microcontroller. The controller was connected to ABB's frequeny converter that controlled the fan of the ventilation system. The system had two modes: manual and automatic. On manual mode the speed of the fan was adjusted by the user, whereas on automatic mode the speed of the fan was adjusted such that the air pressure inside the system stabilized to the air pressure of the room.

This Graphical UI library was used to present the fan speed, air pressure and operation mode information of the system on a 2x16 LCD display.
